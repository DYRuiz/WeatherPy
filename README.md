# WeatherPy

## Overview
Use weather and Google Maps APIs to retrieve hotel information and weather information for selected travel locations based on user input search criteria of minimum and maximum temperatures.  Data for 2000 random latitude and longitude pairs were generated to start an initial locations list, then filtered for the nearest cities to the generated coordinates.  An API call retrieved weather information for the filtered city list then the city list further filtered based on user input search criteria (min. temp 70 degrees, max. temp 90 degrees).  A Google Maps API call retrieved hotel information for the cities within the search criteria.  Four locations within Sri Lanka were chosen to map a vacation intinery with directions between the hotel locations.
